% This program implements the method of anchor position calibration
% described in the paper "Iterative approach for anchor configuration of
% positioning systems" by Mathias Pelka, Grigori Goronzy and Horst
% Hellbrueck.
%
% Placement of the anchors with the following assumptions:
%   - Anchor 1 is set to be the origin of the coordinate system
%   - Anchor 3 and 5 are fixed on the same height as anchor 1
%   - Anchor 2, 4 and 6 are fixed at a known constant height
%   - Anchor 5 is assumed to be on the same axis with anchor 1 
%     without loss of generality
%   - Top anchors are assumed to have same x/y-coordinates as 
%     bottom anchors
%
% Furthermore, the following points need to be investigated:
%   - How to deal with ranging offset resulting in positioning
%     inaccuracy?
